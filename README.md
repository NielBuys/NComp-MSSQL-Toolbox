# NComp SQL Toolbox
<br>
This tool offers four key functions:<br>
<br>
1. SQL IDE: A basic yet powerful integrated development environment for both Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) and MySQL. The tool allows you to run queries, view result sets, and export them as SQL inserts or updates for easy reuse.<br>
<br>
2. Table Comparison: Compare two tables in one direction, generating SQL scripts to reflect changes across all fields in the selected table. The tables must have identical structures. During the comparison, the tool creates INSERT and UPDATE queries, which can be saved for future execution. Additionally, you can join other tables in the query to limit comparisons to specific records, provided that only fields from the current table are in the final result set.<br>
<br>
3. Import Utilities: A suite of helper tools to assist with importing data efficiently.<br>
<br>
4. Find & Replace: Search for or find-and-replace text across tables and columns, streamlining updates and modifications to your data.<br>
<br>
Installs for the following environments are available. Win64, Win32 and Linux Debian.<br>
